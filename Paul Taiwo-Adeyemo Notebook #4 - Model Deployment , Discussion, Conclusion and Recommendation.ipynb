    ">As it turns out, medications are not a good predictor of whether or not a patient would be readmitted for diabetes-related illness. On the other hand, lifestyle choices are a good predictor of getting diabetes. There was a good correlation between income, physical activity, BMI and diabetes. \n",
    "For income, the proportion of patients who got diabetes increased as the income increased. The negative proportionality would make sense as fruits and vegetables are expensive, and people would likely opt for unhealthy food options as they are much cheaper. \n",
    "The proportion of patients that had diabetes spiked when the BMI was between 39 and 41. This makes sense, as this range of BMI indicates morbid obesity.\n",
    "Another interesting finding from the EDA is that a large proportion of patients that were readmitted for diabetes came to the hospital as an emergency, and most of them came in for blood-related illnesses.\n",

The only problem with the second subset of dataset 1 was that it had an unusually high recall rate, with some models showing over 90% recall. This can be a result of the overfitting dilemma.\n",

    "#### Improvements Over Prior Works on the Same Dataset\n",
    "Much work has been done in the past on the UCI Diabetes dataset, with the accuracy peaking at 65% from researchers at the Oklahoma State University. However, I was able to improve on the accuracy and achieved an accuracy of  76.1% in the second subset of the dataset. With biological data, extrapolations are hard to make as there are too many interpersonal differences and health predictors rarely generalize, in short biology is a science of exceptions. This makes it hard to come up with strong predictors in the case of diabetes research. However, based on this project we can conclude that lifestyle choices are a good predictor of the likelihood of developing diabetes, while medical history says very little about the chances of being rehospitalization, with BMI and physical activity being the two best predictors of the incidence of diabetes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Deployment and Practical Use of Machine Learning Product\n",
    "The interactive web apps from the model deployment can be used by users to make preemptive predictions about their relationship with diabetes. The Logistic model of the second dataset was made into a pickle file. A python app file containing instructions on how to execute the model in a web application, and the pickle file was used to create an interactive web application using Heroku. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Further Work\n",
    "From my research I noticed that there is very little data available that combines lifestyle choices with hospital data collected from patients. A dataset that includes both the patients' lifestyle choices along with the hospital data would be very useful data in building better machine learning models. This work can be improved by combining more healthcare data on diabetes, especially those with data on the lifestyle choices of people with diabetes. \n",
